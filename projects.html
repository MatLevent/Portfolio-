      <p>A young boy lost in the forest, who falls upon a star who helps him back home; however, things are not as simple as they seem.

      <p>I pitched this film along side our director Vanessa Ndikanwu, in front of an industry panel, and having the opportunity of getting selected. The biggest impact I made on this film was that I tested and created workflows to facilitate production for other team members, increasing productivity and quality. I was also able to take the time to develop some new rigging skills making the rigged character more intuitive for the animators to animate with. I was also tasked with developing the final look of the film, as the Compositing Lead, making the director's view a reality.

      <p>
This production was a welcomed challenge with a quick turnaround of 2 and a half months. I really enjoyed the technical side of figuring out how to blend the 3 mediums together, demonstrating some strong problem-solving skills. Good established organisation and communication was another really important aspect of this production I had to develop as the pipeline was not fully streamlined and traditional.
